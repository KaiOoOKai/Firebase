## Authentication
### There are two main categories of Authentication.
#### The first one is called Drop-in authentication solution.
#### The second one is called Firebase SDK Authentication. It includes Email and password based authentication, Federated identity provider integration(Google, Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub accounts.), Phone number authentication, Custom auth system integration(Connect your app's existing sign-in system to the Firebase Authentication SDK and gain access to Firebase Realtime Database and other Firebase services.) and Anonymous auth(Use features that require authentication without requiring users to sign in first by creating temporary anonymous accounts. If the user later chooses to sign up, you can upgrade the anonymous account to a regular account, so the user can continue where they left off.)
